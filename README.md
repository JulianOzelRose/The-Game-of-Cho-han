# The Game of Cho-han
Cho-han is a traditional Japanese gambling game in which a dealer uses a cup to roll two six-sided
dice. The cup is placed upside down on a table so the value of the dice is concealed. Players then wager
on whether the sum of the dice values is even (Cho) or odd (Han). The winner, or winners, take all of
the wagers, or the house takes them if there are no winners. There are 36 possible outcomes in Cho-han.

# Gameplay
This program runs as a console app. To play, simply enter the names for player 1 and player 2. Then for every turn,
each player will enter their guess. This will repeat until the number of rounds has hit the pre-set number. Then, the
winner will be announced. It is possible for a tied game to occur, which the game will detect and announce. To
change the number of rounds, simply change the value in ```main``` at ```ChoHan myGame(n)```.
