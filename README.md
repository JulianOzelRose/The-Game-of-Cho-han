# Final Project: The Game of Cho-Han
Cho-Han is a traditional Japanese gambling game in which a dealer uses a cup to roll two six-sided
dice. The cup is placed upside down on a table so the value of the dice is concealed. Players then wager
on whether the sum of the dice values is even (Cho) or odd (Han). The winner, or winners, take all of
the wagers, or the house takes them if there are no winners.
